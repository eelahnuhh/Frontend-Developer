            It's a joy to look back to where you started and see how much you
            have grown over time. When I created this basic landing page, I felt

            create and I was ready to create more things right when I finished!
            Looking back to this project, I see what I could have changed to
            make it better and that motivates me to keep coding and creating new

            working hard to keep putting out new ideas is the key to success and
